## Getting Started

First, change the password in env.json to your postgres login. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
npm i
npm run setup
```

This will setup your local postgres database and install the required packages.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
